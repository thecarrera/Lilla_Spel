# Lilla_Spel
Notes:
Meshes vertecies are loaded in wrong causing explosion of the mesh.

Shadowmap set but still not working.
Shadow maps .png is to big to push, will be found in shared Z/folder.
Textures for the depth buffer is different to the Render Target View
causing conflicts!

Collision buggs when switching between menu and in-game render loop.
Reads Enter keypress multiple times, causing collision to think we activated a lever?
